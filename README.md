## Lessons Learned

This personal project that I have created helped me a lot in knowing how a full stack web application works (even if it is a bit simple) from the backend (API, database, middleware) towards the frontend (state management, UI libraries, components). Some of the key things I learned include:

- Learned how to configure RESTful APIs using Express.js and Node.js to work alongside with the database and the frontend
- Learned how to setup a cloud database (Neon) and deploy the application on the cloud (Render)
- Learned how global state management (Zustand) helps in keeping states organized and easy-to-use
- Learned the beauty of Masonry layout (react-masonry-css) in organizing components
- Learned to use built-in components of Bootstrap to speed up UI development
